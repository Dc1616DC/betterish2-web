## Testing the Fixed Features

### 1. Swipe Gestures Test
- **Right swipe** → Task should turn green and be marked complete
- **Left swipe** → Task should turn orange and be snoozed to tomorrow
- **Far left swipe** → Task should turn red and be dismissed permanently

### 2. Promises Section Test
- Create a manual task yesterday (or modify database)
- Check dashboard for "You Promised" section
- Test the three buttons:
  - **Add to Today** → Should move task to today's list
  - **Snooze** → Should move task to tomorrow
  - **Dismiss** → Should permanently remove task

### 3. Voice Recording Test
- Tap microphone button
- Say something like "Add task to buy groceries and remind me to call mom"
- Should transcribe and create separate tasks

### 4. Navigation Test
- Visit root URL (/) → Should redirect to dashboard if logged in, login if not
- Bottom navigation should work between Dashboard, Browse, Loose Ends

### Debug Console Commands

If you want to test the promises section manually, you can add test data:

```javascript
// In browser console on dashboard page
// This creates a task from yesterday for testing
const yesterday = new Date();
yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
yesterday.setHours(10, 0, 0, 0);

const testTask = {
  title: "Test task from yesterday",
  detail: "This should appear in promises",
  userId: "your-user-id", // Replace with your actual user ID
  createdAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(yesterday),
  source: "manual"
};

// Add to Firestore
firebase.firestore().collection('tasks').add(testTask);
```
